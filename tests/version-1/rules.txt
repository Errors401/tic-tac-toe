[93mTic-Tac-Toe is really a simple game, you only have to figure out what the other player who is playing against you might do next.

[93m#How does the game work?

[93m1. The game is played by two players.
[93m2. The game is played on a grid that is composed of nine squares.
[93m3. You have to pick one of the two symbolic letters: 'X' or 'O'.
[93m4. The first player who gets three squares in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) is the winner.
[93m5. You can not choose the same square the other player has chosen.
[93m6. If all of the nine squares are full, and none of the players get three squares in a row. The game will end with a tie.

[93mHINT: To beat your opponent you need a strategy to get three squares in a row. On the other hand, you have to follow a strategy in order to stop your opponent from getting three squares in a row.
