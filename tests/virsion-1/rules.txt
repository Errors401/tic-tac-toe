Tic-Tac-Toe is really a simple game, you only have to figure out what the other player who is playing against you might do next.
 
How does the game work?

1. The game is played by two players.
2. The game is played on a grid that is composed of nine squares.
3. You have to pick one of the two symbolic letters: 'X' or 'O'.
4. The first player who gets three squares in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) is the winner.
5. You can not choose the same square the other player has chosen.
6. If all of the nine squares are full, and none of the players get three squares in a row. The game will end with a tie.

HINT: To beat your opponent you need a strategy to get three squares in a row. On the other hand, you have to follow a strategy in order to stop your opponent from getting three squares in a row.
